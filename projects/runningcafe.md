summary: "I designed a running cafe for outdoor oriented people such as runners and hikers where they can enjoy food and drinks while also implementing a dog park underneath to ensure a diverse community can use the cafe"

I started a project through my work experience with Ryder where I learned essential skills, one of those skills being Revit which is what I used to design the cafe. One of the key features of this cafe is the raised platform which was inspired from my precedent study of Le Corbusier. To maximise the space created by the raised roof, which I implemented in order to prevent as much damage to the environment as possible, I included a dog park underneath as during my site analysis I discovered it is common for dog walkers to pass through that route. Inside the dog park I incorporated lockers that can store leashes and other items. The key can be collected from the till â€” this not only provides an extra layer of security to customers but also influences them to purchase goods as they have to enter the cafe to then get a key for the locker.
