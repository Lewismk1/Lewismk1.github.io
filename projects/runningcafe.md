summary: "Designed a cafe for runners and outdoor-oriented people that considered the surrounding environment; my first project alongside Ryder Architecture."

I started a project through my work experience with Ryder where I learned essential skillsâ€”one of those skills being Revit, which I used to design the cafe.

One of the key features of this cafe is the raised platform, inspired by my precedent study of Le Corbusier. To maximise the space created by the raised roof and minimise site disturbance, I included a dog park underneath, as my site analysis showed frequent dog walkers. Inside the dog park I incorporated lockers for leashes and other items; the key can be collected from the till, encouraging customers to enter the cafe while providing security.
