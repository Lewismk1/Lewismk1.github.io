summary: "Collaborated with a group of students to design and construct a model bridge and present it to others through a presentation board"

content: "This project took 6 weeks where me and three other students had to work together to build a bridge that had requirements such as, being 400mm long, under 200mm high and only using 100 popsicles. Although difficult we managed to complete this task and used a baltimore bridge design to achieve this which consisted of lower trusses in order to provide stability and higher efficiency when it comes to a higher payload. We did research other designs but finally settled on this as we found the bridge visually appealing while also efficient in its job."
